## Installation

To download our repository, open your terminal and go to the directory in which you will want this repository. Run the command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CPSECapstone/GSP.git
```
to make a local copy. Next, open the "react-native" folder, and run the command
```bash
npm i
```
to install the necessary dependencies. Now, you are able to run our app and any tests with
 ```bash
 npm start
 ```
 and 
 ```bash
 npm test
 ```
but at this moment we have not written any code or tests. This will be done in Winter 2022 (CSC402).
